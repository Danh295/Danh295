### Hi, I'm Danny ðŸ‘‹
Just a highschool student with aspirations of eventually becoming a programmer/developer

I work on some small projects from time to time; most of my code will be private since I'm mainly using this platform to just keep a record for now

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning C/C++, Java, and Python
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking towards learning about front-end development
